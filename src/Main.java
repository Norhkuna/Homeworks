        // homework 1
        //Question 1:
        //      State two(2) fundamental operations and two(2) compound operations
        //      Fundamental operations = addition and subtraction
        //      Compound operations = simulate a situation in real life or analyze data

        //Question 2: State three essential features of a programming language
        //      1. Reserved words always have the same meaning (eg. int always means an integer)
        //      2. Requirement of syntax while programming doesn't change
        //         (eg. using a semicolon is always necessary at the end of statements)
        //      3. The language allows programmers to write their code
        //         according to structured programming concepts, to avoid creating errors.

        //Question 3: Outline the operation of a compiler
        //          A compiler translates any given language's source code into machine code
        //          which can be understood by the computer
