        // homework 1
        //Question 1:
        //      State two(2) fundamental operations and two(2) compound operations
        //      Fundamental operations = addition and subtraction
        //      Compound operations = simulate a situation in real life or analyze data

        //Question 2: State three essential features of a programming language
        //      1. Reserved words always have the same meaning (eg. int always means an integer)
        //      2. Requirement of syntax while programming doesn't change
        //         (eg. using a semicolon is always necessary at the end of statements)
        //      3. The language allows programmers to write their code
        //         according to structured programming concepts, to avoid creating errors.

        //Question 3: Outline the operation of a compiler
        //          A compiler translates any given language's source code into machine code
        //          which can be understood by the computer

        // Question 4: Describe one reason for the use of constants
        //             Constants can make a program easier to read and understand

        public static void main(String[] args)
        {
            int A = 4, B = 4;

            if(A == B)
                System.out.println( A * A + B * B );
            else
                System.out.println(A + B);
        }
